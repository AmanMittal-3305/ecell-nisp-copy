                    Akhil Chopra, Senior Creative Director at Schbang who introduced to everyone
                    briefly about Rebranding and why it plays an important role in today's industry</li>

                    repositioning of a brand/change in mission and vision of the brand or to contemporise
                    and undust the brand in an attempt to adapt to the modern markets and newer
                    customer base. Rebranding is also possible in the case of mergers or in the case of a
                    new leadership as in the case of Burberry.

                    understand the need and the purpose for the rebranding. The next step involves the
                    required changes as accepted by the involved company which could include a change
                    in the logo, the brand personality, digital architecture, typography etc.

                    given a problem statement to Rebrand patanjali. This segment tested the participants

                    present their solution within a 2hr time limit.</li>
                <li>The Result:
                    After every team pitched in their solutions, the speaker Mr Akhil announced the
                    results and our Incubation dept team emerged as the winner with one of the most
                    creative and successful rebranding propagandas. The team members were then
                    rewarded with Amazon gift vouchers as a show of appreciation to their brilliant
                    solution to the problem.</li>
